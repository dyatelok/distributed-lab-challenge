# Piñatas

This problem can be easily solved using "divide and conquer" strategy. When we smash piñata - two segments we get don't influence each other's total amount of candies, and we can solve same problem for them. This has been optimized using memorization table and recursion.

Example: `cat data/test.txt | cargo run`
